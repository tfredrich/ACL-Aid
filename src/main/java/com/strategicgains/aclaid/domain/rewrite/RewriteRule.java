/**
 * In Zanzibar, Userset rewrite rules are defined per relation in a namespace. Each rule specifies
 * a function that takes an object ID as input and outputs a userset expression tree.
 * 
 * Userset rewrite rules are translated to boolean expressions as part of check evaluation.
 *
 * For example, the following rule specifies that the userset for a relation is the intersection
 * of the "owner" and "editor" relations unioned with the "viewer" relation:
union(
	intersection(
		relation(inputObj, "owner"),
		relation(inputObj, "editor")
	),
	relation(inputObj, "viewer")
)

Outputs:
       +--union--+
      /           \
     /             \
    /               \
intersection      viewer
  /       \
owner    editor


union {
   child { _this {} }
   child { computed_userset { relation: "owner" } }
}

Outputs:
     union
    /     \
_this     computed_userset
                   \
               relation: owner

union {
  child { _this {} }
  child { computed_userset { relation: "editor" } }
  child { tuple_to_userset {
    tupleset { relation: "parent" }
    computed_userset {
      object: $TUPLE_USERSET_OBJECT  # parent folder
      relation: "viewer"
    }
 }}
}

Outputs:
